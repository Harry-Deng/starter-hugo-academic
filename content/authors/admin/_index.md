I am Yimo Deng, an **Information Security** major studying at the Software College of Northeastern University, China. I have aspirations of becoming a scientific researcher in the future.

My research interests include **network security** and **wireless networks**. Specifically, I am interested in exploring the fields of **security and privacy**, with a focus on developing secure systems and protect the privacy in mobile communications. Currently, my research delves into the applications of **distributed machine learning** in VANETs.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I am passionate about **software development**. I have completed several interesting projects, including an encryption and decryption software and a packet-sniffing software similar to Wireshark. Engaging in scientific research and development brings me great joy.
